Program 3 -- Semaphores and Operating System Simulator --

To run the program. 
1. compile by running 'make'
1.5 you will get two executables 
2. run ./oss -h to get the list of options and an example of how to run
3. an example to run this program would be ./oss -s 10 
  lunches oss with 10 children process and it should terminate all of them once done
4. type 'make clean' to remove all .o files in the directory 



-h is help and displays all of the naming options
-s is the amount of children to spawn max is 20
-l is the name of the log file. default is log.txt
-t is the time in sets where the master will terminate itself dfefault is 2


Notes -----

semaphores are complicated to set up. Every example is different and i had an issue 
where a semaphore would close randomly on its on.
